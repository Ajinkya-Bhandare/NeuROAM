iperf to measure bandwidth

look through doodle monitor packages

do they do have static ips

are firewalls diabled?

it seems I can ping orange box from both of them but they can't ping eachorther using iperf (regular ping is fine)

not firewall issue

can ping with iperf3 -s seems to have some loss

seems I can get information from the json in this format 

To test between them we need to have one in server mode and the other in client mode, the orange box I presume is already in server mode, so that is why we can ping that
