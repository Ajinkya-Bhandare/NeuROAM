Got it — if the only goal is **lossless recording to a bag on one Jetson**, treat the machine like a data logger and ruthlessly optimize for local I/O. Here’s a focused playbook that works well with high‑res cams + 128‑beam LiDAR.

# 0) Keep everything local & lightweight

* **Run all publishers + `ros2 bag` on the same Jetson.** No external subscribers, dashboards, RViz, image viewers, or bridges during recording.
* If you don’t need DDS at all during logging (no remote subs), **one Jetson + rmw\_zenoh with SHM** (or your preferred RMW) is fine—just ensure the recorder subscribes with *sensor-data* QoS so it never back‑pressures publishers.

# 1) Use the fastest bag format + a big write cache

* Prefer **MCAP** over sqlite:

  ```bash
  ros2 bag record \
    --storage mcap \
    --max-bag-size 4096 \
    --max-bag-duration 600 \
    -o /data/bags/run_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M) \
    /camera/… /lidar/… /imu/…
  ```

  * `--max-bag-size` (MB) and/or `--max-bag-duration` keeps files rotating so flushes are frequent and safe.
* **Increase the recorder write cache** (varies by ROS 2 distro; if supported on yours):
  `--max-cache-size 1073741824` (1 GiB) or larger if you have RAM. Bigger cache = fewer disk stalls.

# 2) Recorder QoS: never block the publishers

Publishers (cameras/LiDAR) should run at their native QoS. Make the **recorder** subscribe as `best_effort`, shallow depth, and `volatile` durability via overrides:

`recorder_qos.yaml`

```yaml
topics:
  - topic: /camera/left/image_raw
    qos:
      reliability: best_effort
      durability: volatile
      history: keep_last
      depth: 5
  - topic: /camera/right/image_raw
    qos:
      reliability: best_effort
      durability: volatile
      history: keep_last
      depth: 5
  - topic: /lidar/points
    qos:
      reliability: best_effort
      durability: volatile
      history: keep_last
      depth: 5
  # ...repeat for all high-rate topics
```

Run with:

```bash
ros2 bag record --storage mcap \
  --qos-profile-overrides-path recorder_qos.yaml \
  <topics...>
```

This prevents reliable‑QoS backpressure from the bag process causing drops upstream.

# 3) Turn on zero‑copy paths (same host)

* **rmw\_zenoh SHM:** enable shared memory in your zenoh session/router config so the recorder receives via SHM instead of socket copies (both ends must agree).
* **Intra‑process:** won’t help between your publishers and `ros2 bag` (separate processes), but do enable it *inside* any composable pipelines to cut CPU between nodes in the same container.

# 4) Cut bytes at the source (only where acceptable)

* **Images:** If you don’t absolutely need RAW for post‑processing, record **`image_transport/compressed`** topics instead of raw. That’s a 5–20× bandwidth reduction. (Publish both if you’re unsure; at least test the delta.)
* **LiDAR:** If your 128‑beam supports dual returns/extra fields, set **single return** and drop unused fields in `sensor_msgs/PointCloud2`.
* **Packet‑level option (power move):** Record the **raw sensor packets** in parallel as `.pcap` (e.g., `dumpcap`/`tcpdump`) and replay later to regenerate point clouds. This often slashes CPU during logging and guarantees verbatim capture.

  ```bash
  sudo dumpcap -i eth0 -f "udp and port 2368 or port 10110" -b filesize:2048 -b files:50 -w /data/pcap/lidar_%F_%H%M%S.pcap
  ```

# 5) Make disk I/O a non‑issue

* **Use NVMe**, not SD/eMMC/USB. Mount with `noatime` and keep >20% free space.
* **Zstd file compression** can *reduce* write bandwidth if CPU headroom exists:

  ```bash
  ros2 bag record --storage mcap \
    --compression-mode file --compression-format zstd \
    <topics...>
  ```

  (If CPU becomes the bottleneck, drop compression and rely on raw throughput.)
* **Isolate I/O:** Don’t log to the same device you’re reading heavy data from. Disable any unrelated logging/services.

# 6) NIC & sensor link smoothing (even for local logging)

* **GigE cameras:** set **packet size** (e.g., 8192) and **inter‑packet delay** so multiple cameras don’t burst at once and overflow the Jetson NIC ring.
* **Jumbo MTU (if supported end‑to‑end):** set MTU 9000 on the Jetson NIC and cameras/switch to cut per‑packet CPU. If anything in the path can’t do jumbo, stick to 1500.

# 7) Jetson Orin Nano performance hygiene

* Lock performance:

  ```bash
  sudo nvpmodel -m 0
  sudo jetson_clocks
  ```
* **Pin CPU affinity & priority:** Give `ros2 bag` its own cores and a higher scheduler priority:

  ```bash
  sudo chrt -f 30 taskset -c 2-3 ros2 bag record ...
  ```

  Put high‑rate publishers on other cores (e.g., 0–1).
* **Kernel buffers (if you see UDP drops):**

  ```bash
  sudo sysctl -w net.core.rmem_max=134217728
  sudo sysctl -w net.core.wmem_max=134217728
  sudo sysctl -w net.core.netdev_max_backlog=30000
  ```
* **NIC rings (if supported):** `sudo ethtool -G eth0 rx 4096 tx 4096`

# 8) Don’t oversubscribe the node graph

* Avoid `-a` (record all). **List only the topics** you truly need.
* Keep CPU‑heavy transforms out of the hot path while recording (no runtime rectification, undistort, voxel filters—do those offline).

# 9) A minimal, repeatable record script (drop‑in)

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -euo pipefail

# Performance
sudo nvpmodel -m 0 || true
sudo jetson_clocks || true

# Network smoothing (optional; adjust to your setup)
# ip link set eth0 mtu 9000 || true

OUT=/data/bags/run_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S)
mkdir -p "$OUT"

# Use a tuned QoS for the recorder
QOS=/opt/recorder_qos.yaml   # put the YAML from above here

# Give bag recorder dedicated cores & priority
exec sudo chrt -f 30 taskset -c 2-3 \
  ros2 bag record \
    --storage mcap \
    --qos-profile-overrides-path "$QOS" \
    --max-bag-size 4096 \
    --max-bag-duration 600 \
    --compression-mode file --compression-format zstd \
    -o "$OUT" \
    /camera/left/image_raw/compressed \
    /camera/right/image_raw/compressed \
    /lidar/points \
    /imu/data
```

# 10) Quick validation loop

1. Start publishers only; confirm no drops at source (`diagnostics`, device stats).
2. Start the recorder with QoS overrides; watch CPU (`htop`) and disk write MB/s (`iostat`, `iotop`).
3. Toggle compression on/off; pick whichever yields *lower* total dropped frames.
4. If drops persist: enable packet capture for LiDAR (pcap) and record point clouds at a lower rate (or skip PC2 entirely and post‑process from pcap).

---

If you want, I can tailor the exact `recorder_qos.yaml` and a per‑topic list for your graph (topic names + rates + byte sizes) and estimate the **required write throughput** vs. your NVMe’s sustained write so we know whether to rely on compression or raw throughput.
